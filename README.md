# RL-Based-Quantum-Circuit-Generator

Built as part of the Winter in Data Science 2022-2023 organized by the Analytics club, IIT Bombay.

A reinforcement learning agent learns which gates to apply on which qubit to construct an efficient (less number of gates used) quantum circuit that takes a system of two qubits in $|00\rangle$ to any arbitrary 2-qubit state $|\psi\rangle$.
